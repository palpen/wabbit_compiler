# Project 2 - The Interpreter

In this project, you will build a definitional interpreter that
directly executes [WabbitScript](WabbitScript.md) from the associated
data model.  Essentially you will be able to take all of the models
you defined in `script_models.py` and make them run in some way. The
purpose of this project is to understand how programs evaluate.

Go to the file `wabbit/interp.py` and follow the instructions inside.
