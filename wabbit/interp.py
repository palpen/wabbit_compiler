# interp.py
#
# In order to write a compiler for a programming language, it helps to
# have some kind of specification of how programs written in the
# programming language are actually supposed to work. A language is
# more than just "syntax" or a data model.  There has to be some kind
# of operational semantics that describe what happens when a program
# runs.
#
# One way to specify the operational semantics is to write a so-called
# "definitional interpreter" that directly executes the data
# model. This might seem like cheating--after all, our final goal is
# not to write an interpreter, but a compiler. However, if you can't
# write an interpreter, chances are you can't write a compiler either.
# So, the purpose of doing this is to pin down fine details as well as
# our overall understanding of what needs to happen when programs run.
#
# We'll write our interpreter in Python.  The idea is relatively 
# straightforward.  For each class in the model.py file, you're
# going to write a function similar to this:
#
#    def interpret_node_name(node, env):
#        # Execute "node" in the environment "env"
#        ...
#        return result
#   
# The input to the function will be an object from model.py (node)
# along with an object respresenting the execution environment (env).
# The function will then execute the node in the environment and return
# a result.  It might also modify the environment (for example,
# when executing assignment statements, variable definitions, etc.). 
#
# For the purposes of this projrect, assume that all programs provided
# as input are "sound"--meaning that there are no programming errors
# in the input.  Our purpose is not to create a "production grade"
# interpreter.  We're just trying to understand how things actually
# work when a program runs. 
#
# For testing, try running your interpreter on the models you
# created in the example_models.py file.
#

from .model import *

# Top level function that interprets an entire program. It creates the
# initial environment that's used for storing variables.

def interpret_program(model):
    # Make the initial environment (a dict)
    env = { }
    interpret(model, env)

# Internal function to interpret a node in the environment
def interpret(node, env):
    # Expand to check for different node types
    ...
    raise RuntimeError(f"Can't interpret {node}")
