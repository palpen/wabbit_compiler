# Project 2 - The Interpreter

In this project, you will build a definitional interpreter that
directly executes
[WabbitScript](https://github.com/dabeaz/compilers_2020_05/wiki/WabbitScript)
from the associated data model.  Essentially you will be able to take
all of the models you defined in `script_models.py` and make them run
in some way. The purpose of this project is to understand how programs
evaluate.

Go to the file `wabbit/interp.py` and follow the instructions inside.
