# script_models.py
#
# Within the bowels of your compiler, you need to represent programs
# as data structures.   In this file, you will manually encode
# some simple Wabbit programs using the data model you're creating
# in the file wabbit/model.py
#
# The purpose of this exercise is two-fold:
#
#   1. Make sure you understand the data model of your compiler.
#   2. Have some program structures that you can use for later testing
#      and experimentation.
#
# This file is broken into sections. Follow the instructions for
# each part.  Parts of this file might be referenced in later
# parts of the project.  Plan to have a lot of discussion.
#
# Note: This file only includes examples for WabbitScript.  See
#
# https://github.com/dabeaz/compilers_2020_05/wiki/WabbitScript.md
