# Project 1 - The Model

To start the compiler project, we're going to focus on the problem of representing programs as a proper data structure.  The focus of this project is on the [WabbitScript](https://github.com/dabeaz/compilers_2020_05/wiki/WabbitScript) subset of the Wabbit language. 

## Setup

In the top-level directory, you will find the file `script_models.py` as well as the `wabbit/` directory.  This is
where you will be doing most of your work.  However, please make sure you are working in your own GitHub branch:

```
bash $ git checkout -b yourname
bash $ git push origin -u yourname
```

## Your task

Go to the file `script_models.py` and follow the instructions inside.  You will mainly be editing `script_models.py` and `wabbit/model.py`.

If you are feeling ambitious, you can also look at the files `func_models.py` and `type_models.py`.  However, those files are challenging.  It will probably make more sense to come back to them later.
