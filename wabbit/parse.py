# Wabbit parser.  The parser needs to construct the data model or an
# abstract syntax tree from text input.  The grammar shown here represents
# WabbitScript--a subset of the full Wabbit language.  It's written as
# a EBNF.  You will need to expand the grammar to include later features.
#
# Reference: https://github.com/dabeaz/compilers_2020_05/wiki/WabbitScript
#
# The following conventions are used:
# 
#       ALLCAPS       --> A token
#       { symbols }   --> Zero or more repetitions of symbols
#       [ symbols ]   --> Zero or one occurences of symbols (optional)
#       s | t         --> Either s or t (a choice)

# How to proceed:  
#
# At first glance, writing a parser might look daunting. The key is to
# take it in tiny pieces.  Focus on one specific part of the language.
# For example, the print statement.  Start with something really basic
# like printing literals:
#
#     print 1;
#     print 2.5;
#
# From there, expand it to handle expressions:
#
#     print 2 + 3 * -4;
#
# Then, expand it to include variable names
#
#     var x = 3;
#     print 2 + x;
#
# Keep on expanding to more and more features of the language.  A good
# trajectory is to follow the programs found in the top level
# script_models.py file.  That is, write a parser that can recognize the
# source code for each part and build the corresponding model.  You
# will find yourself filling in pieces here throughout the project.
# It's ok to work piecemeal.
#
# Usage of tools:
#
# If you are highly motivated and want to know how a parser works at a
# low-level, you can write a hand-written recursive descent parser.
# It is also fine to use high-level tools such as 
#
#    - SLY (https://github.com/dabeaz/sly), 
#    - PLY (https://github.com/dabeaz/ply),
#    - ANTLR (https://www.antlr.org).

from .model import *
from .tokenize import tokenize

# Top-level function that runs everything    
def parse_source(text):
    tokens = tokenize(text)
    model = parse_tokens(tokens)     # You need to implement this part
    return model

# Example of a main program
def parse_file(filename):
    with open(filename) as file:
        text = file.read()
    return parse_source(text)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        raise SystemExit('Usage: wabbit.parse filename')
    model = parse(sys.argv[1])
    print(model)
