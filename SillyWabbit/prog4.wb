/* Define a struct Point that represent a point (x, y) in 2D.
   Write a function midpoint that computes the midpoint of a line-segment drawn 
   between points p1 and p2.

   Compute and print the midpoint of the line drawn between (20, 25) 
   and (40, 55).

   Note: The midpoint is computed by calculating the average of the x 
   coordinates and the average of the y coordinates.

   Can you define a struct Line that consists of two Points?  Can
   you modify the midpoint() function to operate on a Line?
